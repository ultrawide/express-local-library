Hi, this is a local library project that I worked on to learn the foundations of NodeJS/Express/MongoDB/PUG. Please contact me at colinchan02@gmail.com for any feedback; they're always appreciated! :)

Along the way, I've gained a lot of fundamental knowledge about controllers, managing flow control when using asynchronous operations, creating views using Pug, querying the site's database using models, passing information to a view, and creating and extending templates. I've also learned how to create forms using Pug, validate and sanitize input using express-validator, and add, delete, and modify records in the database.

Finally, I've learned about security vulnerabilities and reducing traffic bandwith, and deploying the application onto a cloud host Heroku. Please try it out!
