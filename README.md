# express-local-library

Deployed on heroku: https://glacial-waters-76160.herokuapp.com/catalog

Local library catalog project to learn the foundations of NodeJS/Express/MongoDB/PUG/CRUD/MVC.

I gained fundamental knowledge about controllers, flow control when using asynchronous operations, views using Pug, querying the site's database using models, passing information to a view, and creating and extending templates. I've also learned how to create forms using Pug, validate and sanitize input using express-validator, and add, delete, and modify records in the database.

Finally, I've learned about security vulnerabilities and reducing traffic bandwith, and deploying the application onto a cloud host Heroku. Please try it out!

To start locally:
1. clone package
2. npm install
3. npm run serverstart
4. Access browser and enter in localhost:3000
